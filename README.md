# Neuroimage Plugins
Hello! I am a Research Assistant based in Bengaluru, India and working at Center for Brain Research, IISc on indentifying protective and risk factors associated with dementia. The repository contains necessary small plugins which can be used with popular neuroimaging softwares, such as <a href='https://neuro-jena.github.io/cat/'>Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12)</a>. 

Update: 01 May 2024

1. Added cat_image_metrics: Using .mat files generated during VBM in CAT12 to generate table of metrics associated with image QC for all subjects

2. Added DTI: Preprocessing pipeline using FSL commands turned into scripts for ease

3. To add: REHO-based timeseries extraction from fMRI images for CONN toolbox
